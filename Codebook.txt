INTRODUCTION
============
These files contain data for experiments with 30 volunteers who performed six specific activities while wearing a smartphone to record data from anembedded accelerometer and gyroscope.  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were recorded. The subjects were randomly split into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers' data was used as the training data and 30% as test data.

The original data can be found in this zip file, along with a README file that describes the data:

DATA TRANSFORMATION
===================
The tidy_table contains a subset of the raw data.  Data for the two sets of subjects (test and train) were combined into one table with no distinction between the train and test subjects (they can, however, be identified based on their Subject id).  Only measurements for mean and standard deviation calculations were included in the tidy_table.

The average_table starts with the data in the tidy_table and computes the averages of each feature, function, and direction combination, grouped by subject and activity.  The averages were calculated using the mean() R funtion.



TABLE VARIABLES
===============

tidy_table
==========
This intermediate table can be recreated by using the run_analysis.R script included in this repository.  It contains the data found in the original data files, arranged into one table.

variables
---------
Subject: a number between 1-30 for the 30 volunteers for this experiment
Test volunteers include: 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24.
Train volumteers include: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

Activity: the activity performed by the subject while recording data
There are 6 possible values: STANDING, SITTING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING UPSTAIRS.

Feature: Type of measurement taken.  Each value includes one or more of these parts:
Domain signal: t=time or f=frequency 
Acceleration signal: Body or Gravity
Signal instrument: Acc=accelerometer or Gyro=gyroscope
Additional calculated signals: Jerk=Jerk or Mag=Magnitude

List of possible values:
fBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk
fBodyAccMag
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyro

tBodyAcc
tBodyAccJerk
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyAccMag
tBodyGyro
tBodyGyroJerk
tBodyGyroJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tGravityAcc
tGravityAccMag

Function: Mathematical function performed for each feature
he possible values are: mean()=mean or std()=standard deviation

Direction: Axial direction of each feature.  The possible values are:
X
Y
Z

Note that some of the features are three axial signals and do not have a Direction value.  NA is used for direction of these features.

Measurement: Calculation value for each Feature, Function, and Direction combination.
The accelerometer signals use standard gravity units 'g'
The gyroscope signals use radians/second units


average_table
=============
This final table can be found in the repository in the averages file.  I can be read into R using the read.table() function with row.name=FALSE.  It can also be recreated by using the run_analysis.R script included in this repository.  It contains the data found in the original data files, arranged into one table.
